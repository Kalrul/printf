The printf project is a collaboration between Mamudou Bojang and Sabrina Robert, actual students of Software Engineering at ALX where a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf". _printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and print data. Its prototype is the following: int _printf(const char *format, ...);.
